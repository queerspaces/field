<h1>The field drunk cheap vodka and gin</h1>

<div class="hello">Maybe I’m about to throw up.  Maybe I’m about to burst like a bleach bottle exposed to oxygen.  Maybe my drink has carved my face into the shape of the moon.  At the cast party, I think about girls whose hair is draped in the yellow light of a sidewalk.  We sit in a field and talk about unimportant things like vitamins or how stuffy student kitchens are.  I daydream about our clean house and cats and vibrators and laughing over karaoke.  But then I think about the boys behind me like a lurching cramp.  My entire body is a pair of wet jeans.  There is nothing more humiliating than wanting a straight girl to place her chin on the nook of your shoulder and text you at 3 am. Like calling your new coworker the wrong name or walking into an advanced level yoga class when you meant to go to the beginners. I keep all of this hidden under my tongue,  A city of sloppy deleted messages, and my fear of being kissed platonically because I’ll taste like a loose tooth.  Her mouth sits open like the hollow of a guitar.  Sometimes I crush my knuckles into my ribcage to see if I’ll blush for the wrong reasons.  Like the memory of a boy with artificially colored hair pressing his body fast food sweaty onto my bloated stomach.  Or the gin slicing my tongue as another boy’s blurry mouth moves towards me like a speeding train.  Now a straight girl is kissing me, her breath catches me by surprise and it is as if I am sitting between two windows.  Outside of one, I am eczema pink and eating meals of cotton dresses.  Out the other a softened ground melting like a quilt wants my body to be content so desperately.  But the boys behind me.  With a pornographic camera.  Resting on us like an old sofa.  Stay.  And stay.  And stay.  And stay.
